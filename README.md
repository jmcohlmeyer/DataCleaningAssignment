# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project


This repository holds the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data."

The dataset being used is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

## Files

The code takes downloads the data and presents it a folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

The code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is a tidy dataset called `results.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
